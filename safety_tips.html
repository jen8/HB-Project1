<p>If anyone follows you, look confident and let him or her know you are aware of their presence. Don't be polite or engage in conversation.If they continue to follow you, cross the street and/or change directions.</p>

<p>NEVER allow yourself to be removed to a different location.
If you are forced into a vehicle, try to jump from it when stopped for red lights or in traffic.If all else fails, try to force the vehicle into an accident.
If locked in a car trunk, try to open the lock from the inside or disable the tail lights hoping to bring about a traffic stop.
If stopped by police, make a lot of noise so they know you are there.
Don’t try to call the police until the threat is over; spend your energy screaming, fighting and trying to get away, then call the police. </p>

<p>At home,be cautious and contemplate the potential consequences when considering features such as privacy fences which obstruct the view of your home or property from the “extra eyes” of neighbors and police.
</p>

<p>With children, play the “what if” game: What if we got separated here at the store, who would you ask for help? Quizzing and practice actually builds a “script” in their brains so they have something useful to reference during stressful situations.</p>
